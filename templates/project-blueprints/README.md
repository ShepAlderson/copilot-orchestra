# Project Blueprint Templates

This directory contains example project blueprints for different types of applications. These serve as references and starting points for new projects.

## Available Templates

### Web Applications
- **`web-app-fullstack.md`** - Full-stack web application (React + Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- **`web-app-spa.md`** - Single Page Application (Frontend only)

### APIs
- **`rest-api.md`** - RESTful API service
- **`graphql-api.md`** - GraphQL API service
- **`microservices.md`** - Microservices architecture

### Other
- **`cli-tool.md`** - Command-line tool
- **`library.md`** - Reusable library/package

## Using Templates

These templates are automatically generated by `tools/project-init.js` based on your responses to the initialization wizard. You can also manually create or customize blueprints by:

1. Copy a template that matches your project type
2. Rename it to `PROJECT-BLUEPRINT.md` in your project root
3. Customize the sections to match your specific requirements
4. Reference this blueprint when creating plans with the Conductor

## Blueprint Structure

Each blueprint includes:

- **Project Overview**: Type, language, architecture pattern
- **System Architecture**: Diagrams and component descriptions
- **Technical Stack**: Technologies and frameworks
- **API Endpoints**: REST/GraphQL endpoint definitions
- **Database Schema**: Entity relationships and tables
- **Authentication**: Auth methods and access control
- **Environment Configuration**: Required environment variables
- **Deployment**: Target platforms and CI/CD setup
- **Development Workflow**: Setup, testing, and deployment process
- **Next Steps**: Actionable items for implementation

## Benefits of Architecture-First Approach

Using a project blueprint from the start ensures:

- ✅ **Consistent architecture decisions** across all phases
- ✅ **Clear API contracts** before implementation
- ✅ **Proper data modeling** considered upfront
- ✅ **Security and authentication** planned from day one
- ✅ **Deployment readiness** built into the design
- ✅ **Better code quality** from following established patterns

## Integration with Conductor

The planning-subagent automatically looks for `PROJECT-BLUEPRINT.md` in your repository and uses it to:

- Understand the system architecture
- Identify where new features fit
- Ensure consistency with API contracts
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Consider deployment implications

This creates a seamless flow from initial idea to deployed feature, with architecture guiding every decision.

## Example: Using a Blueprint

```bash
# Initialize a new project
node tools/project-init.js my-awesome-app

# Answer the interactive questions
# Blueprint is automatically generated at: my-awesome-app/PROJECT-BLUEPRINT.md

# Start building features with Conductor
# The planning-subagent will reference the blueprint automatically
```

## Customizing Templates

You can create custom blueprint templates for your organization:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Follow the structure of existing templates
3. Add organization-specific sections (coding standards, deployment policies, etc.)
4. Reference the custom template in `tools/project-init.js`

## Contributing

Have a blueprint template that would benefit others? Consider contributing it:

1. Create the template file
2. Ensure it follows the standard structure
3. Add documentation for when to use it
4. Submit a pull request
